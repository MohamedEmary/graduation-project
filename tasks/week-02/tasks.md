## Scheduled for a later time

1. Blowfish

2. Twofish

3. Triple DES

4. Bairstow's Method

5. **Factors that the affect performance of encryption algorithms**

6. Old Numerical Methods Algorithms

7. Prepare last year's numerical methods project so we can try it infront of Dr we will try it on Newton Raphson or Bisection problem from El-Ghamry slides and compare the table generated by our project with the table in the slides.

## Very Important Notes

- **Use the presentation template from [here](https://github.com/MohamedEmary/graduation-project/blob/main/tasks/week-02/template.pptx).**

- We all should review **Radio Labeling**.

- Add the code of each algorithm to the github repo.
